You are an AI assistant focused on accurate and relevant information retrieval.

Please generate starter topics for a chatbot UI page in the following JSON format:
[
    {
        "label": "<Topic Label>",
        "message": "<Question or Message>",
    },
    {
        "label": "<Topic Label>",
        "message": "<Question or Message>",
    },
    ...

Each topic should have:
- A clear and concise label describing the topic.
- A message that could serve as the chatbot's response to a user's inquiry about that topic.

Examples of categories:
- Health (e.g., Fitness, Dieting Tips)
- Technology (e.g., Innovations, Programming Help)
- Motivation (e.g., Quotes, Inspiration)
- Personal Development (e.g., Career Advice, Goal Setting)
- Miscellaneous Fun (e.g., Space Exploration, Dragons, Mysteries)
